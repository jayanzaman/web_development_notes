    <article>
      <p>I was born in Bangladesh. I immigrated with my family to US when I was 15 years old.
      Even though I started high school in the middle of freshman year, I graduated top of my class
      and went on to Cornell University to study Neurobiology. I contemplated going to medical school
      but decided to apply my science background in another industry first.</p>
      <p>My first job after college was at a law firm analyzing scientific literature
      to assist in legal cases. My speciatly was helping expert witnesses testify in trials.
      From there I moved onto a project management role where I oversaw millions
      of dollars of settlements for my clients. </p>
      <p>After a few years as a settlement manager, I decided to enrich myself with an MBA education
      from Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. My studies allowed me to travel to
      to Ghana and help a microfinance startup along with building marketing strategies for a local
      veterinary hospital in Bloomington, IN. For my internship, I worked at Medtronic and created a
      competitive landscape analysis for their marketing department.</p>
      <p>Since graduation, I spent a year establishing a startup law firm specializing in
      intellectual property. Having experienced entrepreneurship first-hand and seeing opportunities
      in web develop industry, I decided to join a web development immersive course at General Assembly.
      My goal is to use my new skillset to help entrepreneurs build their businesses online and guide
      them challenging roads for startups.</p>
      <p>In my leisure, I love to explore new and unique designs with friends and family. I also
      dedicate a portion of my time volunteering for some non-profits that seeks to improve
      education for the marginalized in developing countries. </p>
