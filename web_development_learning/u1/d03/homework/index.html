            <h3>Healthcare</h3>
                <p>Healthcare industry in US is facing big challenges where the cost of care
                is increasing at a rate much higher than the quality of care. Opportunities
                to improve the system have become a focus in recent times. It's my goal to
                lend my skill-sets towards some of these improvements.</p>

            <h3>Law</h3>
                <p>The legal industry has been one of the slowest in adapting technology to
                improve various processes. As more and more attorneys recognize the value
                of technology in offering more efficient services for their clients they are
                setting themselves apart in a competitive marketplace. My background in law
                allows me help companies and law firms set up processes to minimize their
                exposure and reduce cost.</p>

        <div class="business">
            <h3>Business Analytics</h3>
                <p>Adapting to changing business environment is critical to the success of
                many companies. Many are beginning to treat data as another asset that can
                provide great insights into their business and industry. I seek to help
                companies analyze relevant data sources and develop strategies to utilize
                the insights derived from them.</p>
